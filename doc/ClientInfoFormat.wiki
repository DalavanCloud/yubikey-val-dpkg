= Format of Client Info Data = 

This file holds data used in the YubiKey OTP validation phase.

The file is an OpenPGP signed and encrypted text file.  Readers should
support both CRLF and LF line endings.  The values are text and
separated by comma ("," ASCII 0x2C).  The first line of the file MUST
be as follows:

```
# ykclient 1
```

Each of the rest lines in the file follows the following format:

```
id,hmacSecret # comment
```

Any data after a # is treated as a comment and is ignored.  Lines of
the following format:

```
# comment
```

are also treated as comments.

The meaning are as follows:

{|
|id || the client identity
  	        decimal integer
|-
|hmacSecret || printable ascii string with shared HMAC secret for client id
|}

Examples of valid data lines:

```
1,foobar
2,whatever # not used
```

Example of actual data using the password 'foobar' (normally it would
be encrypted to a particular OpenPGP key id):

```

== Naming Scheme ==

The files should use the standard GnuPG output extension '.asc'.  We
suggest using the filename "yk-client-info.asc".
